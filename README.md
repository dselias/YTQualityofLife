When watching a video that's inside a playlist / Watch Later,
Youtube decided it was a great idea to remove the trashcan to a popup instead of directly next to the video preview. Once this feature is enabled the popup will be disabled and you'll now be able to delete videos by clicking on the trashcan like before.
