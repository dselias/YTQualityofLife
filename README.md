# Features

On first use **all** features are disabled. Click the extension icon in the top right of your screen and select the features you want to enable.

## Highlight

You can highlight videos on the subscriptions page by writing a keyword in the input field located next to 'TODAY' in your Youtube subscription page.
Either clicking enter or pressing the search button works.
### **Note:** this feature has been relocated to the left (unfolded) sidebar above Home, Explore, Shorts, Subscriptions, ...

## HermitcraftHighlight
Videos containing Hermitcraft in their title will automatically be highlighted. Besides that it is identical to the feature mentioned above.

## PlaylistRemovePopup

When watching a video that's inside a playlist / Watch Later,
Youtube decided it was a great idea to remove the trashcan to a popup instead of directly next to the video preview. Once this feature is enabled the popup will be disabled and you'll now be able to delete videos by clicking on the trashcan like before.

# How to install

I can't upload to the Chrome Webstore because of a registration fee. You'll have to install the extension by enabling developer options.

1. Download the latest files. You can find them on the [releases](https://github.com/dselias/YTQualityofLife/releases) page under "Assets".
2. Unzip and place all files in a folder you've created on a desired location. (Or clone the repository on your machine.)
3. Go to chrome://extensions
4. Click "developer mode" in the top right corner. With dev mode enabled you can use extensions that aren't packed.
5. Click "load unpacked" in the top left corner. Select the folder where you've downloaded all files in.

## Updating the extension
1. Delete the files out the folder and redownload all files to the folder you've created. (Or pull the latest changes if you've cloned the repository.)
2. In chrome://extensions: Click on the refresh button on the bottom right of the extension
3. If done correctly the version number next to the title of the extension should be changed.

# Reporting bugs
I use the extension myself daily. Everything I commit works at the time of the commit. Obviously bugs will appear over time when Youtube updates their site.
If you discover any bugs/issues feel free to open a ticket on the [issues](https://github.com/dselias/YTQualityofLife/issues) tab.
