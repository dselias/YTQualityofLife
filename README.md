On first use **all** features are disabled. Click the extension icon in the top right of your screen and select the features you want to enable.

## Highlight

You can highlight videos on the subscriptions page by writing a keyword in the input field located in the left (unfolded) sidebar above Home, Explore, Shorts, Subscriptions, ...

## HermitcraftHighlight
Videos containing Hermitcraft in their title will automatically be highlighted. Besides that it is identical to the feature mentioned above.

## PlaylistAutoplayDisabled

You can disable autoplay when watching videos normally. But when a video ends inside a playlist it automatically starts the next one. This feature automatically stops the video a few seconds before the end so you can peacefully scroll through the comments without being brought to the next video.

## PlaylistRemovePopup

When watching a video that's inside a playlist / Watch Later,
Youtube decided it was a great idea to remove the trashcan to a popup instead of directly next to the video preview. Once this feature is enabled the popup will be disabled and you'll now be able to delete videos by clicking on the trashcan like before.

## PlaylistTotalWatchtimeCounter

Displays the total watchtime of a playlist next to its title.

## VideoTimeLeft

When hovering over a youtube video the progress bar appears. Next to the volume controls you'll find the current and total time of the video. Clicking changes the current time to time left until the video ends.

# How to install

I can't upload to the Chrome Webstore because of a registration fee. You'll have to install the extension by enabling developer options.

1. Download the latest files. You can find them on the [releases](https://github.com/dselias/YTQualityofLife/releases) page under "Assets". (Or clone the repository on your machine.)
2. Unzip and place all files in a folder you've created on a desired location.
3. Go to chrome://extensions

# Reporting bugs
I use the extension myself daily. Everything I commit works at the time of the commit. Obviously bugs will appear over time when Youtube updates their site.
If you discover any bugs/issues feel free to open a ticket on the [issues](https://github.com/dselias/YTQualityofLife/issues) tab.
