# Features

On first use **all** features are disabled. Click the extension icon in the top right of your screen and select the features you want to enable.

## Highlight

You can highlight videos by writing a keyword in the input field located next to 'TODAY' in your Youtube subscription page.

## HermitcraftHighlight
Videos containing Hermitcraft in their title will automatically be highlighted. Besides that it's identical to the feature mentioned above.

## PlaylistRemovePopup

When watching a video that's inside a playlist / Watch Later,
Youtube decided it was a great idea to remove the trashcan to a popup instead of directly next to the video preview. Once this feature is enabled the popup will be disabled and you'll now be able to delete videos by clicking on the trashcan like before.

# How to install

I can't upload to the Chrome Webstore because of a registration fee. You'll have to install the extension by enabling developer options.

# Reporting bugs
I use the extension myself daily. Everything I commit works at the time of the commit. Obviously bugs will appear over time when Youtube updates their site.
If you discover any bugs/issues feel free to open a ticket on the [issues](https://github.com/dselias/YTQualityofLife/issues) tab.
